Three different methods on how to outputting exponential powers

// Description

I created three different methods on obtaining the answer to an exponential power by using template and class,
creating Template <class T>.
Power1 involves a simple iteration.
Power2 uses a tail recursion.
Power3 uses a tail recursion but with the "divide and conquer" strategy. 

// Output
The output conveys the answers to 2^x where x is incrimented by 1. However, the program also conveys the amount of squarings required for each Power template.
Noticably, Power3 requires a significicantly less amount of squarings.

// Purpose

The purpose of this project is to minimize the amount of required memory that is used from the computer (to log n).
